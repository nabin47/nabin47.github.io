Associated with Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology.

I developed this project along with my project partner Jawad Hossain as part of the course project for the CSE-326 Internet Programming(Sessional) course under the supervision of our teacher Omar Sharif.

We have built this website for CUET Central Library using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, SQL, PHP, and JavaScript.

- In the frontend, We have used Bootstrap for layout and JavaScript for interactivity.
- In the backend, we have used PHP to communicate with a MySQL database.
