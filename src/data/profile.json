    "bio": "I am a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science with research interests in machine learning, cybersecurity, and intelligent data-driven systems. My work applies deep learning models such as CNNs, LSTMs, and transformers to real-world security and anomaly detection problems, including federated learning, network intrusion detection, and video anomaly analysis. I have published in IEEE conferences and continue to explore the integration of federated AI and cybersecurity to develop secure and trustworthy systems. I am currently seeking PhD opportunities in Computer Science to advance research in secure and responsible artificial intelligence.",
