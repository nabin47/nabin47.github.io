# A Novel File Entropy Dataset for Crypto-Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning

**Year:** 2025

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel dataset for crypto-ransomware detection based on file entropy. We analyze the entropy patterns of various file types under ransomware attacks and propose a machine learning model to detect such attacks with high accuracy.
