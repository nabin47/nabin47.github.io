## About Me

I am currently a **Lecturer in Computer Science** with research interests spanning **machine learning, cybersecurity, and intelligent data-driven systems**. My work focuses on applying deep learning models—such as **convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), and transformers**—to real-world security and anomaly detection problems.  

I have contributed to several projects, including:
- **Federated learning frameworks** for secure and privacy-preserving medical data analysis.  
- **Network intrusion detection systems** that leverage CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanisms.  
- **Video anomaly detection** and **multimodal sentiment analysis** with emerging AI models.  

My research has resulted in publications in **leading IEEE conferences**, with ongoing work that integrates **federated AI and cybersecurity**. I am passionate about developing **robust, interpretable, and scalable AI methods** that can be applied to critical domains like network security and healthcare.  

In addition to research, I bring several years of **university-level teaching experience**, having taught undergraduate courses such as:
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**  
- **Data Structures**  
- **System Analysis and Design**  
- **Engineering Ethics**  
- **Fundamentals of Computers and Applications**  

I enjoy mentoring students in both classroom and research settings, and I have supervised projects that explore database design, anomaly detection, and applied AI.  

Looking forward, I am preparing to pursue a **PhD in Computer Science**, with the goal of contributing impactful research in **secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence**. My long-term vision is to bridge **theory, applied machine learning, and cybersecurity**, ultimately advancing AI systems that are both powerful and responsible.
